<B>Using:</B>

Training: You can run the part for training without parameters. The program takes Mnist data from the internet and adds the colors reversed to the received data (the accuracy rate has increased significantly) and starts training neural network.

Predict: Predicting with the trained model, Run UsingModel.py with a picture location as a parameter. than It will give the weight values as output.

<B>Be Careful !!!</B>
Image to be used for prediction must be Single Channel (Black and White) and 28 x 28 resolution.
